# Yield Farming Smart Contract

## 📝 Project Description
The **Yield Farming Smart Contract** is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables users to stake their ETH and earn passive income through fixed rewards. It is designed to simulate a basic yield farming protocol where users lock in their funds and receive returns based on a predefined reward rate.

## 🌟 Project Vision
To simplify DeFi adoption by creating a lightweight and transparent yield farming protocol that incentivizes participation in decentralized finance with minimal complexity and maximum accessibility.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Stake ETH:** Users can stake ETH into the contract to start earning.
- **Fixed Rewards:** A reward rate (e.g., 10%) is calculated on the deposited amount.
- **Withdraw Anytime:** Users can withdraw their stake along with accumulated rewards.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Support for multiple tokens using ERC20 interface.
- Implementation of dynamic reward rates based on market conditions or lock-in periods.
- Integration with front-end UI for ease of use.
- Auditing and security enhancements.
- DAO-based governance to manage reward parameters.
